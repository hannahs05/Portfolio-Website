# **Hannah Shahbazi's Portfolio Website**

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This website showcases my interests, links to my projects, and other info about me. I designed it mainly for fun and also to give you a deeper understanding of who I am, my professional journey, and what I’m passionate about.

Feel free to explore the site, view my projects, and get in touch!

## **🚀 About Me**

## 🛠 **Technologies Used**
This website was built using:

## **💡 Future Enhancements**
This was my first website. I mainly used it to teach myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics. I am currently working on a blog website where I can share my writing samples, thoughts, and more. Make sure to look out for that!
